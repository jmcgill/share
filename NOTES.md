### Responsive design

## Domain

Museo Sans, Arial
16px
21.8px line height

Heading is 53px height, 49px line height, 48px font size

box-sizing is border box
color is rgb(109, 110, 112)

max-width: 1400px
margin-left and right 165px

Flow-Type seems useful: http://simplefocus.com/flowtype/

##  Media Queries

Can use this to change font size based on specific widths

@media all and (max-width: 699px) and (min-width: 520px), (min-width: 1151px) {
  body {
    background: #ccc;
  }
}
